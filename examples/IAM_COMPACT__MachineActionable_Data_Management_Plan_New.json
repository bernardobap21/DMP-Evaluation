Therefore, sources are included for each policy for modellers to find out the required details when necessary. In some cases, the overview displays &#34;aspirational targets&#34; apart from regular targets. This is because some stated targets are significantly far away from real-world advancement and the achievement of the &#34;aspirational target&#34; may therefore be unlikely according to tertairy sources (e.g. Climate Action Tracker). <br>For corrections and additional policies not included, contact Dirk-Jan van de Ven: dj.vandeven@bc3research.org",

Part of this study builds upon van Ginkel et al. proposed dimensions of transformational response and resilience to socio-economic impact, to create a novel matrix for exploring climate-related extremes and their socio-economic consequences.</p>\n<p>The resulting scenario matrix yields four distinct narratives: Business as Usual, Unadaptive Transformation, Incremental Resilience, and Effective Transformation. These narratives represent varying combinations of transformational response and resilience to socio-economic impacts, offering a nuanced perspective on potential future pathways. The Business as Usual scenario depicts a society with low transformation and resilience, while the Unadaptive Transformation narrative illustrates the pitfalls of narrow focus in climate change mitigation efforts. Incremental Resilience represents a society that achieves high resilience through expanding existing capacities rather than transformative changes. Finally, the Effective Transformation scenario embodies the ideal resilient future, characterized by significant, well-rounded transformations and high resilience to socio-economic impacts.</p>\n<p>This framework provides a valuable tool for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to assess the complex interplay between climate change tipping points and socio-economic systems, facilitating more informed decision-making and strategy development in the face of climate uncertainties.</p>\n<div></div>\n<p>Results of the study have been documented in D5.4 - Modelling out-of-ordinary extremes (DOI <a href=\"../doi/10.5281/zenodo.13840866\">10.5281/zenodo.13840866</a>)</p>",

This study aims to understand the economic ramifications arising from shifts in behaviour and social innovation within the context of the energy transition as conceptualized in Task 5.5, emphasizing the relevance of behavioural change as an added social value resulting from policy implementation, rather than solely focusing on cost or effectiveness evaluation.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Initially, study 7 carries out a contextualisation of behavioural change by a literature review and an analysis of the behaviour-related policy representation in IAM COMPACT models (based on D4.1 methodology application). Next, it collects and processes stakeholders&rsquo; questions and propositions on behavioural changes and classifies them according to sectors and models which can respond to them. Finally, four scenarios are created from applying different policies, yielding outputs in the fields of energy, climate and land.</p>\n<p>Results of the study have been documented in D5.6 - Behaviour, social and disruptive innovation (DOI <a href=\"../doi/10.5281/zenodo.12751959\">10.5281/zenodo.12751959</a>)</p>",

Three scenarios are analysed in each of which all countries implement their current climate policies and achieve the GHG emissions reduction targets set in their respective NDCs and in their long-term targets, but different steel-related trade constraints are assumed in the three scenarios:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>&ldquo;NDC_LTT&rdquo; scenario: no trade restriction</li>\n<li>&ldquo;CBAM&rdquo; scenario: steel imports to the EU are penalized based on their CO2 footprint</li>\n<li>&ldquo;INDEPENDENCE&rdquo; scenario: steel production levels in the EU may not drop below the level of 2019 (which is guaranteed by subsidies provided for steel production)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The second sub-study on raw material demand for upscaling solar and wind technologies builds on the three scenarios of the steel-related study (see above). Results from GCAM on renewables upscaling were used as an input to some modules of WILIAM which allowed to calculate the raw materials demands implied, which were then compared to current annual extraction and the known global reserves.</p>\n<p>The GCAM model was used to develop scenarios for the steel production in different global regions considering trade and trade restrictions and all other model applications in this study built on these results. The three steel-related scenarios analysed with GCAM all build on the NDC_LTT scenario of study 1 used for the comparison of EU Fit-for-55 policy to a cost-optimal scenario (section 3 of D4.5 (Mittal et al., 2023)). Therefore, all policies included in the NDC_LTT scenario of Study 1 are implicitly included in Study 4 scenarios as well. However, these were not analysed specifically in Study 4. The policy measures explicitly addressed in Study 4 are related to steel trade.

The study&nbsp;aims to explore how non-uniform weighted average cost of capital (WACC), i.e., the discount rate a company uses to estimate its net present value, could influence global decarbonisation pathways.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The study builds on empirically calibrated WACC values by region and technology in global IAMs and expands the modelling analysis by exploring stakeholder-driven pathways of de-risking clean energy technologies and risking fossil fuels. As one of the largest uncertainties lies in the way WACC values are expected to evolve over time, the empirical estimates of baseline WACC values are combined with an expert-based approach to produce forward-looking scenarios of evolving WACCs over time. The study also attempts to incorporate a corrective justice dimension in its narratives, by assessing the impacts of risk underwriting for low-carbon investments through taxing corporate windfall profits for 2022 and distributing the revenue as subsidies towards high-risk regions.</p>\n<p>Results of the study have been documented in D5.6 - Behaviour, social and disruptive innovation (DOI <a href=\"../doi/10.5281/zenodo.12751959\">10.5281/zenodo.12751959</a>)</p>",

In particular, the project will use a diverse ensemble of models, tools, and insights from social sciences and operations research, and will integrate bodies of knowledge to co-create the research process and enhance transparency, robustness, and policy relevance.
