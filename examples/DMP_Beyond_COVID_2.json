This includes the measurement of uptake and coverage of the vaccination, the estimation of vaccine effectiveness, and continuous monitoring of the vaccine&#8217;s safety.

This cohort covers more than 90% of the total population in Belgium. The COVID-19 vaccine related data from the vaccine registry (<b>VACCINNET+</b>) and the COVID-19 test result database (<b>COVID-19 Healthdata Database</b>) are continuously updated and linked (on a daily basis) to the database of hospitalized patients with a confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis (<b>COVID-19 Clinical Hospital Survey</b>) and to the common database for the different public institutions responsible for the recognition of healthcare actors in Belgium (<b>COBRHA</b>). In addition, there are non-continuous linkages (monthly, bi-annual or <i>ad hoc</i>) to the database on reimbursed care and medicines of citizens insured in Belgium (<b>Intermutualistic Agency - IMA</b>) and to the socioeconomic information (civil status, employment status, income decile, ...) from the <b>STATBEL</b> database. <br></div><div><br></div><div>Data from the vaccine registry (VACCINNET +), the TestResult database (COVID-19 Healthdata Database) and the COVID-19 clinical database (COVID-19 Clinical Hospital Survey), are hosted in the HealthData COVID-19 data Center (secured environment), where personal patient data are available. As described above, links are organized with the databases external to healthdata.be (COBRHA, IMA and STATBEL) using the national registry number.
